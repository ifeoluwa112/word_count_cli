Word Count CLI (Rust)

A simple and well-structured Word Count CLI tool, inspired by the Unix wc command, but implemented with a clean Rust project architecture and modern best practices.

This tool reads a text file and reports the number of lines, words, and characters, while handling errors gracefully.

 # Features

Accepts a file path as a command-line argument

Counts:

Lines

Words

Characters

Graceful error handling (missing files, invalid paths, etc.)

Idiomatic Rust project structure

Fully testable logic (unit-test friendly)

Clear separation of concerns

# Learning Goals

This project is designed as a practical learning exercise and demonstrates:

Rust project architecture (src, modules, separation of logic)

File I/O in Rust

Error handling using Result and ?

Ownership and borrowing in real scenarios

Command-line argument parsing

Writing testable Rust code
